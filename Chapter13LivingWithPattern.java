// A pattern is a solution to a problem in a context

// Context is the recurring situation of problem

// Problem should be goal and restraints

// Solution should be a general solution to resolve this kind of problem



// Classification of pattern

// Approach 1

// Creational Pattern :
// Involve object instantiation and all provide a way
// to decouple a client from the objctes it needs to instantiate

// Singleton, Builder, Prototype, Abstract Factory, Factory Method



// Behavioral Pattern :
// Any pattern that is a Behavioral Pattern is concerned with how classes
// and objects interact and distributed responsibility

// Mediator, Visitor, Template Method, Iterator, Command, Memento, Interpreter, Observer
// Chain of Responsibility, State, Strategy



// Structual Pattern :
// Compose classes or objects into larger structures

// Decorator, Composite, Proxy, Facade, Bridge, Flyweight, Adapter





// Approach 2

// Class Patterns :

// Describe how relationship between classes are defined via inheritance. Relationships in class
// patterns are established at compile time

// Template method, factory method, adapter, interpreter

// Object Patterns : 
// Object patterns describe relationships between objects and are primarily defined by composition. Relationships in object patterns are typically created at runtime and
// are more dynamic and flexible.

// all the other could be classified as Object Patterns

// Anti-Pattern : tells you how to go from a problem to a BAD solution

// Anti-Pattern will tell you why a solution is attractive, and long-term bad, and suggest other pattern
