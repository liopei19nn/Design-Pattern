//Good OO designs are reusable, extensible and maintainable.

// Object Oriented Principles
// 1. Encapsulate What Varies
// 2. Favor composition than inheritance
// 3. Program to interfaces, not implementations
// 4. Strive for loosely coupled designs between object that interact






// Object Oriented Patterns

/* 1.Strategy Pattern

	 defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, 
	 and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm 
	 vary independently from clients that use it.

*/


/* 2.Observer Pattern
	
	defines a one-to-many dependency between 
	objects so that when one object changes state,
	all of its dependents are notified and 
	updated automatically.
