//Good OO designs are reusable, extensible and maintainable.

// Object Oriented Principles
// 1. Encapsulate What Varies
// 2. Favor composition than inheritance
// 3. Program to interfaces, not implementations


// Object Oriented Patterns
/* 1.Strategy Pattern

	 defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, 
	 and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm 
	 vary independently from clients that use it.
